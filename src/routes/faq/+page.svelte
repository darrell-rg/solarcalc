    <h2>What is impedance matching and why does it matter?</h2>
    <p>The Maximum Power Transfer theorem says that we must match the load impedance to the source impedance.</p>

    <h2>What about permits?</h2>
    <p>Less/no permits are required since we are not connecting to the grid.</p>

    <h2>Is this better/worse then solar thermal?</h2>
    <p>This system has no moving parts and is easier to install.  It does require more roof area.</p>

  <p>
    I put some used PV panels on my shed's roof and wired them up to the bottom element of my electric water heater. This cut my household electric use in half. Not connected to the grid so no expensive permits needed.
  
    There is no thermostat for the PV panels. The summer power output of the panels comes into equilibrium with the heat loss of the tank at 80-85C. I did add a 93C thermal fuse to augment the safety of the PTV value.
  
    I have a mixing valve on the output of the water heater to mix with cold down to about 50C. This lets you get around 2x the nameplate capacity of hot water out of the tank so there is enough to bridge a cloudy day.
  
  To get the full capacity of the panels, it necessary to choose a water heater element that matches the source impedance(Vmpp/Immp) of the solar panel array
  
  If a squirel chews through the insulation of the wires,  it would be best to full floating.  That way the wire can not short to the earth grounded frame.
