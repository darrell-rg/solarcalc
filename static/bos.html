Hello Josh,  My name is Darrell from fort collins. I am Looking to buy some steel pipe.  
4EA  5" X 8'  19.5#/ft  = 152 lb   
8EA  4" X 8'  14.0#/ft  = 112 lb  @ $20


6 foot stickout of 5 in pipe (r=63.5 t=9) = 737 kn =165,684 lb = 78 ton buckle

6 foot stickout of 4 in pipe (r=50.8 t=8) = 319.3 kN kn =71,714 lb = 32 ton buckle 

1 foot dia helix must be at least 5 foot deep 

helix cost 41.71 /ea for 8 in mild steel at send cut send


Monitoring and testing since 1986 has proven that the minimum installation torque for square
shaft helical piers in expansive soils typically should be 4,000 ft-lbs (5.4 kN-m)(Pack, 2006). This
ensures that the helices are below the active zone and the piers will maintain long-term stability.
Installation torques down to 3,000 ft-lbs (
